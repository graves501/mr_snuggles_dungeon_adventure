This is the source code for the second game I made with Go. There is a free-to-play demo on Steam for Windows and also works on Steam via Proton on Linux https://store.steampowered.com/app/2968730/Mr_Snuggles_Dungeon_Adventure/  

  
Made with the Go bindings for raylib https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go 

  
To compile from source you will need to install raylib-go and the required dependencies. 


Installation instructions are on the raylib-go page https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go
